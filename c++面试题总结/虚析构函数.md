``` cpp
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;
     
    class ClxBase
    {
        public:
            ClxBase() {};
            virtual ~ClxBase() { cout<<"delete ClxBase"<<endl; };
     
            virtual void DoSomething() { cout << "Do something in class ClxBase!" << endl;  };
     
    };
     
    class ClxDerived : public ClxBase
    {
        public:
            ClxDerived() {};
            ~ClxDerived() { cout << "Output from the destructor of class ClxDerived!" << endl;  };
     
            void DoSomething() { cout << "Do something in class ClxDerived!" << endl;  };
     
    };
     
    int main(int argc, char const* argv[])
    {
         ClxBase *pTest = new ClxDerived;
         pTest->DoSomething();
         delete pTest;
         return 0;
    }
```
输出: <br>
```
Do something in class ClxDerived!
Output from the destructor of class ClxDerived!
delete ClxBase
```
若将virtual关键字去掉:
```
Do something in class ClxDerived!
delete ClxBase
```
